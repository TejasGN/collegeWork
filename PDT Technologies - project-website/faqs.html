                        <p>If you have an idea, contact us by our online form, e-mail or phone. We'll meet and talk it
                            over. Just be sure to
                            prepare as much info about your idea as possible, it will smoothen the meeting and benefit
                            further cooperation. If you
                            don't know how to get around to it, go ahead and read our blog entry on how to write a

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Both have their benefits and flaws. Mobile apps are surely more expensive but can provide you
                            with many more data
                            collecting, monetisation capabilities than web applications. Progressive Web Apps are a good
                            compromise between a mobile
                            and web app â€” you can learn more about PWA on our blog. But remember that sooner or later
                            you may need both mobile and
                            web app and when that moment comes we are here for you :)</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>To give you a precise answer we must prepare a project scope and create a budget. We shall
                            tell you how much of that scope can be completed within the budget and we'll be able to
                            estimate how long will it take after at least a month of work. Don't worry, if you're not
                            happy with our work after two weeks you can retract from the project with no penalties, this
                            is our trial period and we believe that any reliable software house should give you one.

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>It depends on many things: project scope, time spent on the project and technological issues.
                            We know it sounds vague
                            but its simply honest. Remember that each software project is different, especially if you
                            had a particularly original
                            idea. We do not want to give you an unrealistic estimate, instead we want to provide you
                            with the best quality possible
                            within your budget. To learn more about our pricing method read our blog entry.

                            React.js. For mobile we use Kotlin and Swift.

                        <p>Not at all! We want you to be sure you'll receive the product you desire. From the planning
                            stage to each finished
                            version, we invite you to evaluate and improve our work. Our philosophy is to work with the
                            client, not merely finish
                            given tasks. We are always ready to listen and communicate.

                        <p>Hopefully the app is exactly what you dreamed of :) But apart from delivering a finished
                            product, we are happy to
                            provide you with technical support and app maintenance should you need it. After all, we
                            know our work inside out. Of
                            course if you want to maintain the app by yourself the source code and all technical data is
                            at your disposal, but even
                            in that case, feel free to contact us if you need any help.

                            as possible and later just add next features along the process. Therefore, you'll be able to
